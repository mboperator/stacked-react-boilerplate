## Getting Started
- npm install
- npm run dev

## Testing
We're currently using [mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) as our
testing framework with the [chai](https://github.com/chaijs/chai)
assertion library.

Tests should go in a `__tests__/` alongside whatever source code they
test.

In order to run tests, simply run the following:
```sh
npm test
```

To have tests run as you edit and save them, run:
```sh
npm run test:watch
```
